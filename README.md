This script generates a private key with the RSA encryption algorithm of 2048, then what it does is to convert the private key to a PEM format file, we write the key to the generated file. Then we generate the public key from the private key. 
Finally we pass the public key to an SSH file and write it to a file.

This script is very customizable, as we can adjust it for our own needs, in this case I have made a rule to block ping, another rule to block RDP protocol, and the last rule allows TCP traffic from one subnet to another over port 80, in this case, the good thing about this is that you can change it to suit your needs.
